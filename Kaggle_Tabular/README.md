Data Analysis and Machine Learning project based on the Kaggle Competition Tabular Playground Series for June 2021. The data for the project is based off of a real dataset,
and has 9 classes for which to predict from. My Machine Learning Project ended up with a competition loss/validation loss of 1.74864, placing me in the top 30% of submissions. 
The Machine Learning algorithm consisted of an Embedding + Conv1D + Fully Connected Layer.
