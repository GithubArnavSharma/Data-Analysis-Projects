Suicide is a large problem in society, and many countries are actively looking for ways to prevent suicides within their countries. There are a large variety factors that determine the suicide rate of a country. Some factors that may be hypothesized include the region the nation resides in, the economic ability of the nation, the welfare spending of a nation, the alchohol use of a nation, and gun ownership. However, none of these factors have a significant affect on the suicide rates of a country, and suicide is instead deep-rooted into the culture of a country.

The region of a nation does have an affect on the suicide rates of the country, but not in the way most would imagine. Looking at the suicide rates per continent and the suicide rates in different parts of Europe, regions generally considered as developed don't follow up with their suicide rates.
