Suicide is a large problem in society, and many countries are actively looking for ways to prevent suicides within their countries. There are a large variety factors that determine the suicide rate of a country. Some factors that may be hypothesized include the region the nation resides in, the economic ability of the nation, the welfare spending of a nation, the alchohol use of a nation, and gun ownership. However, none of these factors have a significant affect on the suicide rates of a country, and suicide is instead deep-rooted into the culture of a country.

The region of a nation does have an affect on the suicide rates of the country, but not in the way most would imagine. Looking at the suicide rates per continent and the suicide rates in different parts of Europe, regions generally considered as developed don't show lower rates of suicide.

When comparing alchohol use to suicide rates, there is a slight positive correlation of ~40% observed, however not enough to prove the relationship is causation and not simply a coincidental correlation.

When comparing economic freedom to suicide rates, there is nearly no correlation observed between the two variables.

A similar lack of relationship can be discovered with Social Spending and suicides.

Despite the widely accepted myth that higher gun ownership is linked to higher suicide rate, there is only a small, insignificant ~11% positive correlation between the two falsely correlated variables. This is because suicidal people tend to find other ways to end their life if guns are hard to get.
